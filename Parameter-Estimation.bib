	Abstract = {The simple Lanczos process is very effective for finding a few extreme eigenvalues of a large symmetric matrix along with the associated eigenvectors. Unfortunately, the process computers redundant copies of the outermost eigenvectors and has to be used with some skill. In this paper it is shown how a modification called selective orthogonalization stifles the formation of duplicate eigenvectors without increasing the cost of a Lanczos step significantly. The degree of linear independence among the Lanczos vectors is controlled without the costly process of reorthogonalization.},

When the GKL recurrence is implemented in finite precision arithmetic, the columns of                                                                           {\$}{\$}U{\$}{\$}                 and                                                                           {\$}{\$}V{\$}{\$}                 tend to lose orthogonality, making a reorthogonalization strategy necessary to preserve convergence of the singular values. The use of an approach started by Simon and Zha (SIAM J Sci Stat Comput, 21:2257--2274, 2000) that reorthogonalizes only one of the two left orthogonal matrices                                                                           {\$}{\$}U{\$}{\$}                 and                                                                           {\$}{\$}V{\$}{\$}                 is shown to be very effective by the results presented here. Supposing that                                                                           {\$}{\$}V{\$}{\$}                 is the matrix reorthogonalized, the reorthogonalized GKL algorithm proposed here is modeled as the Householder Q--R factorization of                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\backslash}left( {\backslash}begin{\{}array{\}}{\{}c{\}} 0{\_}{\{}n {\backslash}times k{\}} {\backslash}{\backslash} X V{\_}k {\backslash}end{\{}array{\}}{\backslash}right) {\$}{\$}                 where                                                                           {\$}{\$}V{\_}k = V(:,1:k){\$}{\$}                .

@article{GazzolaLothar,
	Abstract = {Summary The symmetric Lanczos method is commonly applied to reduce large‐scale symmetric linear discrete ill‐posed problems to small ones with a symmetric tridiagonal matrix. We investigate how quickly the nonnegative subdiagonal entries of this matrix decay to zero. Their fast decay to zero suggests that there is little benefit in expressing the solution of the discrete ill‐posed problems in terms of the eigenvectors of the matrix compared with using a basis of Lanczos vectors, which are cheaper to compute. Similarly, we show that the solution subspace determined by the LSQR method when applied to the solution of linear discrete ill‐posed problems with a nonsymmetric matrix often can be used instead of the solution subspace determined by the singular value decomposition without significant, if any, reduction of the quality of the computed solution.

	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper, we propose new randomization based algorithms for large scale linear discrete ill-posed problems with general-form regularization: ${\min} \|Lx\|$ subject to ${\min} \|Ax - b\|$, where $L$ is a regularization matrix. Our algorithms are inspired by the modified truncated singular value decomposition (MTSVD) method, which suits only for small to medium scale problems, and randomized SVD (RSVD) algorithms that generate good low rank approximations to $A$. We use rank-$k$ truncated randomized SVD (TRSVD) approximations to $A$ by truncating the rank-$(k+q)$ RSVD approximations to $A$, where $q$ is an oversampling parameter. The resulting algorithms are called modified TRSVD (MTRSVD) methods. At every step, we use the LSQR algorithm to solve the resulting inner least squares problem, which is proved to become better conditioned as $k$ increases so that LSQR converges faster. We present sharp bounds for the approximation accuracy of the RSVDs and TRSVDs for severely, moderately and mildly ill-posed problems, and substantially improve a known basic bound for TRSVD approximations. We prove how to choose the stopping tolerance for LSQR in order to guarantee that the computed and exact best regularized solutions have the same accuracy. Numerical experiments illustrate that the best regularized solutions by MTRSVD are as accurate as the ones by the truncated generalized singular value decomposition (TGSVD) algorithm, and at least as accurate as those by some existing truncated&#13; randomized generalized singular value decomposition (TRGSVD) algorithms.},

We investigate analytically the stability of this model with respect to its parameters and link it to a constrained minimization problem. Based on these investigations and a statistical characterization of the mixed Gaussian-impulse noise a fully automated parameter selection algorithm for the L 1 - L 2 -TV model is presented. It is shown by numerical experiments that the proposed method finds parameters with which noise is removed considerably while features are preserved in images.},

Apart from the least squares cost functional, naturally used in bilevel learning, we propose and analyse an alternative cost based on a Huber-regularised TV seminorm.

Based on the adjoint information, a combined quasi-Newton/semismooth Newton algorithm is proposed for the numerical solution of the bilevel problems.

	Abstract = {Computing regularization parameters for general-form Tikhonov regularization can be an expensive and difficult task, especially if multiple parameters or many solutions need to be computed in real time. In this work, we assume training data is available and describe an efficient learning approach for computing regularization parameters that can be used for a large set of problems. We consider an empirical Bayes risk minimization framework for finding regularization parameters that minimize average errors for the training data. We first extend methods from Chung et al (2011 SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 33 [http://https://doi.org/10.1137/100812938] 3132--52 [http://https://doi.org/10.1137/100812938] ) to the general-form Tikhonov problem. Then we develop a learning approach for multi-parameter Tikhonov problems, for the case where all involved matrices are simultaneously diagonalizable. For problems where this is not the case, we describe an approach to compute near-optimal regularization parameters by using operator approximations for the original problem. Finally, we propose a new class of regularizing filters, where solutions correspond to multi-parameter Tikhonov solutions, that requires less data than previously proposed optimal error filters, avoids the generalized SVD, and allows flexibility and novelty in the choice of regularization matrices. Numerical results for 1D and 2D examples using different norms on the errors show the effectiveness of our methods.},

	Abstract = {In bioluminescence tomography (BLT), reconstruction of internal bioluminescent source distribution from the surface optical signals is an ill-posed inverse problem. In real BLT experiment, apart from the measurement noise, the system errors caused by geometry mismatch, numerical discretization, and optical modeling approximations are also inevitable, which may lead to large errors in the reconstruction results. Most regularization techniques such as Tikhonov method only consider measurement noise, whereas the influences of system errors have not been investigated. In this paper, the truncated total least squares method (TTLS) is introduced into BLT reconstruction, in which both system errors and measurement noise are taken into account. Based on the modified generalized cross validation (MGCV) criterion and residual error minimization, a practical parameter-choice scheme referred to as improved GCV (IGCV) is proposed for TTLS. Numerical simulations with different noise levels and physical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and potential of TTLS combined with IGCV for solving the BLT inverse problem.},

@article{Woolfeetal,
	Abstract = {We describe two recently proposed randomized algorithms for the construction of low-rank approximations to matrices, and demonstrate their application (inter alia) to the evaluation of the singular value decompositions of numerically low-rank matrices. Being probabilistic, the schemes described here have a finite probability of failure; in most cases, this probability is rather negligible (10?17 is a typical value). In many situations, the new procedures are considerably more efficient and reliable than the classical (deterministic) ones; they also parallelize naturally. We present several numerical examples to illustrate the performance of the schemes.},

@article{DavisKahan,
	Abstract = {When a Hermitian linear operator is slightly perturbed, by how much can its invariant subspaces change? Given some approximations to a cluster of neighboring eigenvalues and to the corresponding eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix, and given an estimate for the gap that separates the cluster from all other eigenvalues, how much can the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors differ from the subspace spanned by our approximations? These questions are closely related; both are investigated here. The difference between the two subspaces is characterized in terms of certain angles through which one subspace must be rotated in order most directly to reach the other. These angles unify the treatment of natural geometric, operator-theoretic and error-analytic questions concerning those subspaces. Sharp bounds upon trigonometric functions of these angles are obtained from the gap and from bounds upon either the perturbation (1st question) or a computable residual (2nd question). An example is included.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Regularized Total Least Squares is a useful approach for solving ill-posed overdetermined systems of equations when both the model matrix and the observed data are contaminated by noise. A Newton-based Regularized Total Least Squares method was proposed by Lee et al. (2013) [16], but may not be efficient for large scale problems. Here we consider two projection-based algorithms applied to this method for the solution of the large scale problem. The first fixes the underlying subspace dimension, while the second expands the subspace dynamically during the iterations by employing a generalized Krylov subspace expansion. Experimental results demonstrate that the two projection-based algorithms can be successfully applied for the solution of the large scale Regularized Total Least Squares problems. },

The algorithm combines some existing regularization techniques and regularization parameter choice rules with a randomized singular value decomposition (SVD), so that only much smaller scale systems are needed to solve, instead of the original large-scale regularized system. The algorithm can directly apply to some existing regularization methods, such as the Tikhonov and truncated SVD methods, with some popular regularization parameter choice rules such as the L-curve, GCV function, quasi-optimality and discrepancy principle. The error of the approximate regularized solution is analyzed and the efficiency of the method is well demonstrated by the numerical examples.},

Our first approach transforms general form inverse problems into standard form, then we apply randomized algorithms to reduce large-scale systems of standard form to much smaller-scale systems and seek their regularized solutions in combination with some popular choice rules for regularization parameters. Our second approach involves a new random generalized SVD algorithm that can essentially reduce the sizes of the original large-scale ill-posed systems. The reduced systems can provide approximate regularized solutions with about the same accuracy as the ones by the classical generalized SVD, but they are much more stable and much less expensive as they need only to work on problems of much smaller sizes. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithms.},

Next, we describe and compare approaches based on the use of the low rank singular value decomposition (SVD), which can result in further size reductions. We describe how to obtain the approximate low rank SVD of the original matrix using the sparser wavelet compressed matrix. Some analytical results concerning the various methods are presented and the results of the proposed techniques are illustrated using both synthetic data and a very large linear system from a seismic tomography application, where we obtain significant compression gains with our methods, while still resolving the main features of the solutions.},

@article{stefan3,
	Abstract = {A method to improve the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR)of positron emission tomography (PET) scans is presented. A wavelet-based image decomposition technique decomposes an image into two parts, one which primarily contains the desired restored image and the other primarily the remaining unwanted portion of the image. Because the method is based on a texture extraction model that identifies the desired image in the space of bounded variation, these restorations are approximations of piecewise constant images, and are referred to as the cartoon part of the image. Here an approximation using a wavelet decomposition is used which allows solutions to be computed very efficiently. To process 3-D volume data a slice by slice approach in all three directions is adopted. Using a redundant discrete wavelet transform, 3-D restorations can be efficiently computed on standard desktop computers. The method is illustrated for PET images which have been reconstructed from simulated data using the expectation maximization algorithm. When post-processed by the presented wavelet decomposition they show a significant increase in SNR. It is concluded that the new wavelet based method can be used as an alternative to the well established de-noising of PET scans by smoothing with a Gaussian point spread function. In particular, if the volume data are reconstructed using the EM algorithm with a larger number of iterations than the number of iterations that would be used without post-processing, the 3-D images are sharper and show more detail. A MATLAB{\textregistered} based graphical user interface is provided that allows easy exploration of the impact of parameter choices.},

	Abstract = {Determining parameters which describe the performance of a microbial fuel cell requires the solution of an inverse problem. Two formulations have been presented in the literature: a convolutional approach or a direct quadrature approach. A complete study and analysis of the direct quadrature method, which leads to two systems for the unknown signal given measured complex data, known as the distribution function of relaxation times, is presented. A theoretical analysis justifies the minimal range of integration that is appropriate for the quadrature and suggests that the systems should be combined giving an overdetermined system that is not well posed but not as ill-posed as either system considered separately. All measures of ill-posedness support using the combined data when the level of error in both components of the complex measurements is equivalent. Tikhonov regularization for the filtered singular value and truncated singular value decomposition are used to find solutions of the underlying model system. Given such solutions the application requires the determination of the model parameters that define the signal, among which are the location and peaks of the individual processes of the cell. A nonlinear data fitting approach is presented which consistently estimates these parameters. Simulations support the use of the combined systems for finding the underlying distribution function of relaxation times and the subsequent nonlinear data fitting to these curves. The approach is also illustrated for measured practical data, demonstrating that without the theoretical analysis incorrect conclusions on the underlying physical system would arise. This work justifies the use of Tikhonov regularization combined with nonlinear data fitting for finding reliable solutions for the specific model, when the signal is comprised of a mixture of signals from a small number of processes.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses the reconstruction of compactly supported functions from non-uniform samples of their Fourier transform. We briefly investigate the consequences of acquiring non-uniform spectral data. We summarize two often applied reconstruction methods, convolutional gridding and uniform re-sampling, and investigate the reconstruction accuracy as it relates to sampling density. Finally, we provide preliminary results from employing spectral re-projection methods in the reconstruction.},

@article{stefan2,
	Abstract = {We present a new method for estimating the edges in a piecewise smooth function from blurred and noisy Fourier data. The proposed method is constructed by combining the so called concentration factor edge detection method, which uses a finite number of Fourier coefficients to approximate the jump function of a piecewise smooth function, with compressed sensing ideas. Due to the global nature of the concentration factor method, Gibbs oscillations feature prominently near the jump discontinuities. This can cause the misidentification of edges when simple thresholding techniques are used. In fact, the true jump function is sparse, i.e. zero almost everywhere with non-zero values only at the edge locations. Hence we adopt an idea from compressed sensing and propose a method that uses a regularized deconvolution to remove the artifacts. Our new method is fast, in the sense that it only needs the solution of a single l                1 minimization. Numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method in the presence of noise and blur.},

	Abstract = {Consider an ill-posed problem transformed if necessary so that the errors in the data are independent identically normally distributed with mean zero and variance 1. We survey regularization and parameter selection from a linear algebra and statistics viewpoint and compare the statistical distributions of regularized estimates of the solution and the residual. We discuss methods for choosing a regularization parameter in order to assure that the residual for the model is statistically plausible. Ideally, as proposed by Rust (1998 Tech. Rep. NISTIR 6131 , 2000 Comput. Sci. Stat. 32 333--47 ), the results of candidate parameter choices should be evaluated by plotting the resulting residual along with its periodogram and its cumulative periodogram, but sometimes an automated choice is needed. We evaluate a method for choosing the regularization parameter that makes the residuals as close as possible to white noise, using a diagnostic test based on the periodogram. We compare this method with standard techniques such as the discrepancy principle, the L-curve and generalized cross validation, showing that it performs better on two new test problems as well as a variety of standard problems.},

@article{FastLS,
	Abstract = {Least squares approximation is a technique to find an approximate solution to a system of linear equations that has no exact solution. In a typical setting, one lets n be the number of constraints and d be the number of variables, with                                                                           {\$}{\$}{\{}n {\backslash}gg d{\}}{\$}{\$}                . Then, existing exact methods find a solution vector in O(nd                        2) time. We present two randomized algorithms that provide accurate relative-error approximations to the optimal value and the solution vector of a least squares approximation problem more rapidly than existing exact algorithms. Both of our algorithms preprocess the data with the Randomized Hadamard transform. One then uniformly randomly samples constraints and solves the smaller problem on those constraints, and the other performs a sparse random projection and solves the smaller problem on those projected coordinates. In both cases, solving the smaller problem provides relative-error approximations, and, if n is sufficiently larger than d, the approximate solution can be computed in O(nd ln d) time.},

Our method uses the Tikhonov regularization result as initial value and has an incremental geometric choice of the regularization parameter. We compared our method with previous methods (Tikhonov regularization, Landweber iteration, and integral-iteration method). The downward-continuation performance of these methods in spatial and wavenumber domains were compared with the aspects of their iterative schemes, filter functions, and downward-continuation operators. Applications to synthetic gravity and real aeromagnetic data showed that our iterative method yields a better downward continuation of the data than other methods. Our method shows fast computation times and a stable convergence. In addition, the L-curve criterion for choosing the regularization parameter is expressed here in the wavenumber domain and used to speed up computations and to adapt the wavenumber-domain iterative method.},

	Abstract = {Seismic waveform inversion is a highly challenging task. Nonlinearity, nonuniqueness, and robustness issues tend to make the problem computationally intractable. We have developed a simple regularized Gauss-Newton--type algorithm for the inversion of seismic data that addresses several of these issues. The salient features of our algorithm include an efficient approach to sensitivity computation, a strategy for band-limiting the Jacobian matrix, and a novel approach to computing regularization weight that is iteration adaptive. In this paper, we first review various forward modeling and differential seismogram computation algorithms and then evaluate different strategies for choosing the regularization weight. Under the assumption of locally 1D earth models, we design an efficient algorithm by rearranging recursion formula in the reflection matrix approach to compute plane wave seismograms and the Fr{\'e}chet derivative matrix as a by-product of forward modeling. We then demonstrate that in a gradient-descent--type optimization scheme, regularization is critical for obtaining stable and geologically realistic solutions. Although, in most applications, the regularization weight (relative importance between data and model misfit) is chosen in an ad-hoc manner; the robustness in model estimation and computational stability improve significantly by allowing adaptivity in the choice of the regularization weight in each iterative step. We evaluate performances of several methods, namely, an L-curve approach, generalized cross-validation technique, and methods based on a discrepancy principle with application to field ocean-bottom-cable data, and we propose a new hybrid approach in computing iteration adaptive regularization weight for prestack inversion.},

In principle, the depth-resolution plot provides a convenient visual tool for this analysis, but its computational complexity has hitherto prevented application to large-scale problems. To analyze depth resolution in such problems, we developed a variant ApproxDRP, which is based on an iterative algorithm and therefore suited for large-scale problems because we avoid matrix factorizations and the associated demands on memory and computing time. We used the ApproxDRP to study retrievable depth resolution in inversion of the gravity field of the Neapolitan Volcanic Area. Our main contribution is the combined use of the Lanczos bidiagonalization algorithm, established in the scientific computing community, and the depth-resolution plot defined in the geoscience community.},

	Abstract = {Emerging applications of transient electromagnetic (TEM) surveys, such as monitoring of groundwater aquifers or tracking fluid movement within petroleum reservoirs, require the acquisition of high resolution time-lapsed (4D) data sets, using three-component receivers to maximize information. However, separating signal from noise in TEM surveys can be difficult, and the magnitude of the time-lapse difference is often on the order of the noise. A method is developed for extracting signal from noisy three-component TEM data sets collected in fixed-loop, multiple-receiver surveys using a novel application of the equivalent source technique. This method takes advantage of the relationship between the three components of the observed decaying magnetic field to improve data contaminated by uncorrelated random noise, such as that due to receiver coil misalignment and location errors. Both synthetic and field three-component TEM data are used to demonstrate the viability of the technique. The results suggest it is feasible to use the method in processing time-lapsed TEM data, allowing for an improved signal to noise ratio in 4D survey data.},

	Abstract = {We present an algorithm for inverting induced polarization (IP) data acquired in a 3-D environment. The algorithm is based upon the linearized equation for the IP response, and the inverse problem is solved by minimizing an objective function of the chargeability model subject to data and bound constraints. The minimization is carried out using an interior-point method in which the bounds are incorporated by using a logarithmic barrier and the solution of the linear equations is accelerated using wavelet transforms. Inversion of IP data requires knowledge of the background conductivity. We study the effect of different approximations to the background conductivity by comparing IP inversions performed using different conductivity models, including a uniform half-space and conductivities recovered from one-pass 3-D inversions, composite 2-D inversions, limited AIM updates, and full 3-D nonlinear inversions of the dc resistivity data. We demonstrate that, when the background conductivity is simple, reasonable IP results are obtainable without using the best conductivity estimate derived from full 3-D inversion of the dc resistivity data. As a final area of investigation, we study the joint use of surface and borehole data to improve the resolution of the recovered chargeability models. We demonstrate that the joint inversion of surface and crosshole data produces chargeability models superior to those obtained from inversions of individual data sets.},

The algorithm then uses this sparse matrix to construct the the equivalent source directly in the wavelet domain. Performing an inverse wavelet transform then yields the equivalent source in the space domain. Using upward continuation of total-field magnetic data between uneven surfaces as examples, we have compared this approach with the direct solution using the dense matrix in the space domain.

	Abstract = {We study the inversion of magnetic data acquired over a rugged observation surface and where the buried source bodies have strong remanent magnetization that leads to unknown total magnetization directions. These factors pose significant challenges for processing and inversion of such data. To tackle the challenges from both a rugged observation surface and an unknown magnetization direction, we propose a strategy through the joint use of the equivalent source technique and 3D amplitude inversion to obtain 3D magnetization strength. We use equivalent source processing to calculate the amplitude data in the space domain because the use of the wavenumber-domain method is invalid due to large variations in the data elevation. We then carried out an amplitude inversion to generate a 3D subsurface distribution of the magnitude of the total magnetization vector. The results from a synthetic example and aeromagnetic data in Daye Mine in China showed that this approach is effective and images the magnetic units whose contact zones with the limestone country rock host the mineralization. The method is general and can be applied to a variety of cases with similar challenges.},

	Abstract = {Several approaches exist to use trends in 3D seismic data, in the form of seismic attributes, to interpolate sparsely sampled well-log measurements between well locations. Kriging and neural networks are two such approaches. We have applied a method that finds a relation between seismic attributes (such as two-way times, interval velocities, reflector roughness) and rock properties (in this case, acoustic impedance) from information at well locations. The relation is designed for optimum prediction of acoustic impedances away from well sites, and this is accomplished through a combination of cross validation and the Tikhonov-regularized least-squares method. The method is fast, works well even for highly underdetermined problems, and has general applicability. We apply it to two case studies in which we estimate 3D cubes of low-frequency impedance, which is essential for producing good porosity models. We show that the method is superior to traditional least squares: Numerous blind tests show that estimated low-frequency impedance away from well locations can be determined with an accuracy very close to estimations obtained at well locations.},

	Abstract = {Airborne magnetic survey data sets can contain from hundreds of thousands to millions of observations and typically cover large areas. The large number of measurements combined with a model mesh to accommodate the survey extent can render an inversion of these data intractable. Faced with this challenge, we have developed a three-step procedure to locally optimize the degree of model discretization and to compress the corresponding sensitivity matrix for the inversion of magnetic data. The mesh optimization is achieved through the use of adaptive octree discretization. The compression is achieved by first reordering the model cells using the Hilbert space filling curve and then applying the one-dimensional wavelet transform to the corresponding sensitivities. The fractal property of the Hilbert curve groups the spatially adjacent cells into algebraically adjacent positions in the reordered model mesh and thereby maximizes the number of zero or near-zero coefficients in the one-dimensional wavelet transform. Winnowing these insignificant coefficients finally leads to a highly sparse representation of the sensitivity matrix, which dramatically reduces the required memory and CPU time in the inversion. As a result, the proposed algorithm is capable of inverting huge data sets (105 measurements) with commensurate model sizes in a short time on a single desktop computer. As a test, we inverted an entire magnetic data set with 170,000 observations from a large uranium exploration program and achieved a reduction in computational cost exceeding 10,000 times.},

	Abstract = {The limited-memory quasi-Newton method with simple bounds is used to develop a novel, fully 3D magnetotelluric (MT) inversion technique. This nonlinear inversion is based on iterative minimization of a classical Tikhonov regularized penalty function. However, instead of the usual model space of log resistivities, the approach iterates in a model space with simple bounds imposed on the conductivities of the 3D target. The method requires storage proportional to , where N is the number of conductivities to be recovered and  is the number of correction pairs (practically, only a few). These requirements are much less than those imposed by other Newton methods, which usually require storage proportional to  or , where M is the number of data to be inverted. The derivatives of the penalty function are calculated using an adjoint method based on electromagnetic field reciprocity. The inversion involves all four entries of the MT impedance matrix; the  integral equation forward-modeling code is used as an engine for this inversion. Convergence, performance, and accuracy of the inversion are demonstrated on synthetic numerical examples. After investigating erratic resistivities in the upper part of the model obtained for one of the examples, we conclude that the standard Tikhonov regularization is not enough to provide consistently smooth underground structures. An additional regularization helps to overcome the problem.},

@article{Ajo-Franklin01072007,
	Abstract = {Tomographic imaging problems are typically ill-posed and often require the use of regularization techniques to guarantee a stable solution. Minimization of a weighted norm of model length is one commonly used secondary constraint. Tikhonov methods exploit low-order differential operators to select for solutions that are small, flat, or smooth in one or more dimensions. This class of regularizing functionals may not always be appropriate, particularly in cases where the anomaly being imaged is generated by a nonsmooth spatial process. Time-lapse imaging of flow-induced velocity anomalies is one such case; flow features are often characterized by spatial compactness or connectivity. By performing inversions on differenced arrival time data, the properties of the time-lapse feature can be directly constrained. We develop a differential traveltime tomography algorithm whichselects for compact solutions, i.e., models with a minimum area of support, through application of model-space iteratively reweighted least squares. Our technique is an adaptation of minimum support regularization methods previously explored within the potential theory community. We compare our inversion algorithm to the results obtained by traditional Tikhonov regularization for two simple synthetic models: one including several sharp localized anomalies and a second with smoother features. We use a more complicated synthetic test case based on multiphase flow results to illustrate the efficacy of compactness constraints for contaminant infiltration imaging. We apply the algorithm to a -sequestration-monitoring data set acquired at the Frio pilot site. We observe that in cases where the assumption of a localized anomaly is correct, the addition of compactness constraints improves image quality by reducing tomographic artifacts and spatial smearing of target features.},

	Abstract = {Abstract The inverse problem associated with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy requiring the solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind is considered. If the underlying physical model is not clearly determined, the inverse problem needs to be solved using a regularized linear least squares problem that is obtained from the discretization of the integral equation. For this system, it is shown that the model error can be made negligible by a change of variables and by extending the effective range of quadrature. This change of variables serves as a right preconditioner that significantly improves the condition of the system. Still, to obtain feasible solutions the additional constraint of non-negativity is required. Simulations with artificial, but realistic, data demonstrate that the use of non-negatively constrained least squares with a smoothing norm provides higher quality solutions than those obtained without the non-negative constraint. Using higher-order smoothing norms also reduces the error in the solutions. The L-curve and residual periodogram parameter choice criteria, which are used for parameter choice with regularized linear least squares, are successfully adapted to be used for the non-negatively constrained Tikhonov least squares problem. Although these results have been verified within the context of the analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, there is no reason to suppose that they would not be relevant within the broader framework of solving Fredholm integral equations for other applications. },

	Abstract = {We describe two recently proposed randomized algorithms for the construction of low-rank approximations to matrices, and demonstrate their application (inter alia) to the evaluation of the singular value decompositions of numerically low-rank matrices. Being probabilistic, the schemes described here have a finite probability of failure; in most cases, this probability is rather negligible (10?17 is a typical value). In many situations, the new procedures are considerably more efficient and reliable than the classical (deterministic) ones; they also parallelize naturally. We present several numerical examples to illustrate the performance of the schemes.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the solution of numerically ill-posed overdetermined systems of equations using Tikhonov a priori based regularization. When the noise distribution on the measured data is available to appropriately weight the fidelity term, and the regularization is assumed to be weighted by inverse covariance information on the model parameters, the underlying cost functional becomes a random variable that follows a χ 2 distribution. The regularization parameter can then be found so that the optimal cost functional has this property. Under this premise a scalar Newton root-finding algorithm for obtaining the regularization parameter is presented. The algorithm, which uses the singular value decomposition of the system matrix, is found to be very efficient for parameter estimation, requiring on average about 10 Newton steps. Additionally, the theory and algorithm apply for generalized Tikhonov regularization using the generalized singular value decomposition. The performance of the Newton algorithm is contrasted to standard techniques, including the L-curve, generalized cross validation and unbiased predictive risk estimation. This χ 2 -curve Newton method of parameter estimation is seen to be robust and cost effective in comparison to other methods, when white or colored noise information on the measured data is incorporated.},

	Abstract = {A critical problem in inversion of geophysical data is developing a stable inverse problem solution that can simultaneously resolve complicated geological structures. The traditional way to obtain a stable solution is based on maximum smoothness criteria. This approach, however, provides smoothed unfocused images of real geoelectrical structures. Recently, a new approach to reconstruction of images has been developed based on a total variational stabilizing functional. However, in geophysical applications it still produces distorted images. In this paper we develop a new technique to solve this problem which we call focusing inversion images. It is based on specially selected stabilizing functionals, called minimum gradient support (MGS) functionals, which minimize the area where strong model parameter variations and discontinuity occur. We demonstrate that the MGS functional, in combination with the penalization function, helps to generate clearer and more focused images for geological structures than conventional maximum smoothness or total variation functionals. The method has been successfully tested on synthetic models and applied to real gravity data.},

	Abstract = {The two most successful methods of estimating the distribution of nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation times from two dimensional data are data compression followed by application of the Butler--Reeds--Dawson algorithm, and a primal-dual interior point method using preconditioned conjugate gradient. Both of these methods have previously been presented using a truncated singular value decomposition of matrices representing the exponential kernel. In this paper it is shown that other matrix factorizations are applicable to each of these algorithms, and that these illustrate the different fundamental principles behind the operation of the algorithms. These are the rank-revealing QR (RRQR) factorization and the LDL factorization with diagonal pivoting, also known as the Bunch--Kaufman--Parlett factorization. It is shown that both algorithms can be improved by adaptation of the truncation as the optimization process progresses, improving the accuracy as the optimal value is approached. A variation on the interior method viz, the use of barrier function instead of the primal-dual approach, is found to offer considerable improvement in terms of speed and reliability. A third type of algorithm, related to the algorithm known as Fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm, is applied to the problem. This method can be efficiently formulated without the use of a matrix decomposition.},
