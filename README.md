# Parameter-Estimation
Downsampling for regularization parameter estimation is considered in this project.

The filename convention used in this project includes the following information.
1. Descriptor of what the file contains (ex: Data1D, NoisePlot)
2. Test function number, indicated by the number following "F"
3. SNR, indicated by the number following "S"
4. Gaussian PSF width parameter, indicated by the number following "W"
5. Number of noise realizations, indicated by the number following "R"

For example, BothBoxes1D_F2_S05_W100_R20.eps is a image showing two statistical box plots for the 2nd test function with an SNR of 5, a width parameter of 100, and 20 noise realizations.
