# Parameter-Estimation

This project concerns the mathematical research of estimating parameters for the construction of regularized solutions to inverse problems. There are two aspects of the research: the first is the analysis of effects of downsampling data on the estimation of useful parameters, and the second is the formulation of methods adapted for the simultaneous inclusion of multiple data sets.
